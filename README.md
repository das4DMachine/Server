Just another RESTful webserver based on SLIM for a prototype. This one is made for use in a project in the course 3D interaktion on Aarhus University.

Apart from the webserver there are also som HTML files with simple forms that supply different functionalities for the prototype and server.

Note to self: one should provide the file userdetails.php comtainign the following constants for the DB connection to work:


```php
const PASSWORD = "PASSWORD";
const USERNAME = "USERNAME";
const NAME = "DB_NAME";
const HOST = "HOST_NAME";
```
